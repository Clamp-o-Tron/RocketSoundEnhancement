//	### SOUNDLAYER ###
//	name 				SoundLayerName 												Must be unique
//	audioClip 			SoundName eg: ModFolder/Sounds/SoundName					Soundlayers can borrow the same clips
//	loop 				true, false													Default is false
//	channel 			ShipInternal, ShipExternal, ShipBoth						Default is ShipBoth, not the same as vanilla channel
//	spread				0-1	(0 to 360 degrees)										Default is 0, see https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioSource-spread.html
//
//	data				Physics Controls
//							Acceleration											Change in Velocity in m/s
//							Jerk													Change in Acceleration in m/s
//							AirSpeed												Surface Speed in Atmosphere in m/s
//							GroundSpeed												Surface Speed on Ground in m/s
//							Thrust													Total Ship Thrust in kN
//							None													Fallback if the data type is invalid
//
//						Collision Controls (Can be left Empty)
//							Concrete												Everything besides ground, includes vessels, excludes Asteroids
//							Dirt													Ground
//
//	--- FXCurves ---
//	volume 				control				volumeValue 	or SingleValue			Can be left to default, but soundlayer will play forever
//	pitch 				control				pitchValue 		or SingleValue			Leave out for default (1)
